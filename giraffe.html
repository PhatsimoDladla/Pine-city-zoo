                    <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                    <p>The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into four extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, and individual species can be distinguished by their fur coat patterns. Six valid extinct species of Giraffa from Africa and Pakistan are known from the fossil record.
The giraffe's distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, horn-like ossicones, and spotted coat patterns. It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi. Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits, and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other ground-based herbivores cannot reach.</p>
                    <p>Giraffes are social animals that live in loose, open herds of up to 20 individuals. They are known for their unique gait, moving both legs on one side of their body and then both legs on the other side, which allows them to run at speeds of up to 37 km/h (23 mph) over short distances. Giraffes communicate through vocalizations, body language, and even infrasonic sounds that can travel long distances.</p>
                    <p>Giraffes are currently listed as vulnerable by the IUCN due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation efforts are underway to protect their populations and habitats.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>You will find the Giraffe at pen E45, right next to the Amphitheatre</p>
